## Project 01: Eames Personality Test
#### by Cellini Luong


### Overview
As a tribute to legendary designers, Charles and Ray Eames, I have created an Eames chair personality test. This interaction will take place as an online quiz and is designed for mid-century modern lovers and chair enthusiasts. Though every Eames chair shares a similar modern, yet functional quality, they undoubtedly each have their own uniqueness to them. This personality quiz will ask you questions in order to determine which chair resonates the most with your personality.

### Technical
In order to create this experience, I used simple states to navigate users to differenct questions and quiz results depending on their previous answer choice. Users will be able to navigate this experience through keys pressed and mouse clicks. I utilized arrays to load my assets and the draw function to recreate the layouts I designed from my prototype.
